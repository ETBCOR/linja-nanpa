Guide for ligatures:
- type the name of any glyph in latin characters (with or without a trailing space) and it will turn into the correct sitelen pona
- ideographic space can be done with `  ` (double space) or `zz`
- cartouches get opened with `[` and closed with `]`
- cartouche colon is `:`
- cartouche interpunct is `.`
- manual lines are `_` for character extensions and `__` for cartouches (unless you want to do some fancy editing or opentype autocartouching isn't available, these shouldn't be necessary)
- containers (character extensions) get opened with `(` and closed with `)`
- scaled glyph combinations are done with `+`
- stacked glyph combinations are done with `-`
- directional ni can be done by adding `>` `^` `<` `v` and combinations thereof to `ni`
- if a glyph has variants, put a number after the word to access it
