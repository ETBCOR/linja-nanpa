## AHK Scripts Guide

[The AutoHotKey scripts](/ahk-script/) maintained in this repository can be used to input the appropriate [sitelen pona UCSUR character](https://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/charts/sitelen.html) by replacing specific strings of (Latin) characters you type. There are 3 versions, all of which work in a very similar way:
| Version | Format of file name | Source text example | Note |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| Main version | `sitelen-pona-X.Y.ahk` | ``akesi`​`` | ``​`​`` ≈ confirm.
| Toggle version | `sitelen-pona-toggle-X.Y.ahk` | `akesi ` | ` ` (space) ≈ confirm. Script can be toggled on/off with `Alt+Space`
| Shorthand version | `stl-pon-X.Y.ahk` | ``aks`​`` | ``​`​`` ≈ confirm. All the words have 3 letter codes (you can view them by right-clicking the script and selecting 'Edit in Notepad')

All 3 scripts support all the characters described in the [__Ligatures Guide__](https://github.com/ETBCOR/nasin-nanpa/blob/main/README.md#ligatures-guide).

See the [__Ligatures Guide__](https://github.com/ETBCOR/nasin-nanpa/blob/main/README.md#ligatures-guide) in nasin nanpa's main readme for a full breakdown of the conversions made by the scripts.

Note: the script version numbering is independent of nasin nanpa's main version numbering.
